<H1>Getting Started with Windows 8.0<br>
by Alice Carrole</H1><br><br><br>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>I have found Windows 8.0 exceptionally easy to use by spending a minimal amount of time viewing 
the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to">Microsoft 
tutorials</a></span>.</strong>  I have watched and listened to many people complain, where if they had 
spent even 25 minutes viewing a few videos and reading tutorials they would have not been so frustrated 
and would be finding their way around Windows 8 and most likely, enjoying their new experience. 
Below are the three that I would recommend, there are more available from Microsoft, and I will share that 
link in my summary.
</p>

<H2>Learning about the Start Menu </H2>
<p>The start menu is different in Windows 8.0, it is now a Start Screen.
The Start screen is the starting point for everything you do with your PC. 
You can think of it like the Start menu you’re used to, but now it’s full-screen, 
and you can personalize it with your apps, friends, and photos. <br>

</p>
<H2>Navigating Around in Windows 8.0</H2>
<p>Learning  how to navigate on your PC, including how to get back to Start, switch 
between apps, and use apps side by side is really easy. Learn how to be more efficient 
with touch or a mouse and keyboard, and learn the top keyboard shortcuts. <br>

<H2>Personalizing the Start Menu</H2>
<p>This is not essential, but I like to have my personal touch for my PC.   <br>

</p>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<p>In less than 25 minutes you will be productively moving around and setting up your PC.  
You will be happy with your invested time, less stress and frustration. 
In addition, you will be able to look at those techies who don't read the manual or watch 
a simple video and laugh as they spew their frustrations and ask YOU for help.<br>
